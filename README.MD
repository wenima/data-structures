#Summary

The assignment was to implement a [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)
in Python containing 3 methods:

* insert(value): inserts a value into the queue. Takes an optional argument for that valueâ€™s priority, set by default to whatever your lowest        priority is (i.e. 0, -99, whatever).
* pop(): removes the most important item from the queue.
* peek(): returns the most important item without removing it from the queue.

# Comments about implementation:

* still looking for ways to improve tests and make them more concise
* fixed a bug in the implementation where the init method did not only reorganize once the passed in iterable was exhausted
