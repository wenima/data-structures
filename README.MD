#Summary

The assignment was to implement deletion for a [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

in Python containing 1 new method:

* delete(self, val): remove val from the tree if present, if not present this method is a no-op. Return None in all cases.

#Definition:
* The node is a leaf (has no descendants)
* The node has one descendant (either left or right)
* The node has two descendants (both left and right)
