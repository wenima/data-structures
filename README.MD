#Summary

The assignment was to implement a traversal for a[binary tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

in Python containing 4 methods:

* in_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using in-order traversal, one at a time.
* pre_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using pre-order traversal, one at a time.
* post_order(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using post_order traversal, one at a time.
* breadth_first(self): will return a generator that will return the values in the tree using breadth-first traversal, one at a time.

#Definition:
* PreOrder traversal - visit the parent first and then left and right children;
* InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child;
* PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent;
