#Summary

The assignment was to implement a [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)
in Python containing 3 methods:

* insert(value): inserts a value into the queue. Takes an optional argument for that valueâ€™s priority, set by default to whatever your lowest        priority is (i.e. 0, -99, whatever).
* pop(): removes the most important item from the queue.
* peek(): returns the most important item without removing it from the queue.

# Comments about implementation:

* we initialize the list with the first value set to 0 per the request of my partner.
* we did not set a default value for priority yet as this assignment was changed later on. For now, it's referenced in GitHub: https://github.com/wenima/data-structures/issues/52
* after some discussion, we decided to go with my proposal of setting a the index inside the tuple in the list as a way to solve the case where 2 items have the same priority
