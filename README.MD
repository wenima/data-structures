#Summary

The assignment was to implement a [weighted Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#weighted_graph)

No additional functions have been added but many functions have been modified.

#Definition:
An edge-weighted graph is a pair (G,w) where G = (V,E) is a graph and w : E â†’ IR is a weight function.

The assignment has a longer definition of an edge weighted graph, combined with a possible approach.

# Comments about implementation:

* With the introduction of larger graphs, we probably need to implement an adjency matrix soon rather than relying on a list to hold the nodes
