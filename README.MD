# Summary

The assignment was to implement a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
as a class with 4 public methods:

* insert(self, string): will insert the input string into the trie. If character in the input string is already present, it will be ignored.
* contains(self, string): will return True if the string is in the trie, False if not.
* size(self): will return the total number of words contained within the trie. 0 if empty.
* remove(self, string): will remove the given string from the trie. If the word doesnâ€™t exist, will raise an appropriate exception.


# Definition:
A trie is a tree data structure in which the root holds references to all following characters eventually leading down
to leaves which either hold the complete string or the end is signaled by '$'. Trie nodes can have the following representations:
* an array
* a Binary-Search-Tree
* a hash-table

# Comments about implementation:

For all implementations, the assignment also requires to state the time and space complexity.
